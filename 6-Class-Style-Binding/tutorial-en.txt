1-'data() { ... }': This function defines the initial data for the Vue application. It includes the following properties:

    -'showBorder': A boolean initially set to 'false'. This state determines whether a class will be applied or not.
    -'redBG': Another boolean initially set to 'false'. This state determines whether a class will be applied or not.
    -'boxClass': A string array of class names. Initially set as "border red". However, this data will be replaced with a computed class.
    -'bgColor': A background color. Initially set as "cyan".

2-'computed: { ... }': This section specifies computed properties. Computed properties provide values that are calculated based on 
existing data.

    -'boxClasses()': The purpose of this computed property is to dynamically set classes. It returns an object: it maps the 
    "border-dashed" class to the 'showBorder' state and the "red" class to the 'redBG' state.

3-'app.mount("#app");': This mounts the Vue application to an HTML element with the id '#app'.

-The purpose of the code is to demonstrate dynamic class and style management. It shows how classes are added or removed based on the 
'showBorder' and 'redBG' states. It also illustrates how the 'boxClass' property can be updated with computed classes, showcasing the flexibility 
of computed properties in class management.
