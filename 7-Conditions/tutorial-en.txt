1-'data() { ... }': This section defines the initial data for the Vue application.

    -'showContainer': This is a flag variable initially set to 'false'. It determines whether a container will be displayed or not. 
    In this code example, it appears to not be used.
    -'counter': The counter value, initially set to '0'.

2-'computed: { ... }': This section specifies computed properties.

    -'counterBoxClass()': This computed property dynamically sets classes based on the 'counter' state. If the 'counter' has a positive value, it adds the 
    'bg-success' (green background) and 'text-white' (white text) classes. If the 'counter' has a negative value, it adds the 'bg-danger' (red background) 
    and 'text-white' classes. If the 'counter' is 0, no class is added.

3-'app.mount("#app");': This mounts the Vue application to an HTML element with the id '#app'.

-In summary, this code demonstrates a simple example where the background and text colors are dynamically changed based on a counter value. If the counter 
is positive, it applies a green background and white text; if negative, it applies a red background and white text. If the counter is 0, no classes are added. 
This showcases how computed classes can be used for dynamic style management.
