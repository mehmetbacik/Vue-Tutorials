1-'data() { ... }': This function defines the Vue application's data model. It contains two numerical data items 
used to store the application's state: 'counter' and 'counter2'. Both are initially set to 0.

2-'methods: { ... }': This section contains the methods (functions) that the Vue application can use. 
However, in this example, the methods are commented out (indicated by the commented lines), meaning these methods are not being used.

3-'computed: { ... }': This section defines computed properties. Computed properties are used to store 
values calculated based on data. There are two computed properties:

    -'getCounterResult': This computed property returns "Big" or "Small" based on the 'counter' value.
    -'getCounter2Result': Similarly, this computed property returns "Big" or "Small" based on the 'counter2' value.

4-'watch: { ... }': This section is used to watch for changes in specific data. It allows triggering actions based on observed changes. For instance:

    -It watches changes in the 'counter' and 'counter2' data and logs their old and new values to the console.
    -It also watches the results of the 'getCounterResult' and 'getCounter2Result' computed properties and logs their old and new values to the console.

-The purpose of this code is to serve as an example of understanding Vue.js's reactivity features and data flow. It utilizes Vue properties like 
'computed' and 'watch' to observe changes triggered by data modifications or calculations and understand how they behave.
