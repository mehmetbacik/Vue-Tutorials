1-'data() { ... }': This section defines the initial data for the Vue application.

    -'todoList': An array containing to-do items. Each item is represented as an object with properties like 'id' (a unique identifier), 
    'text' (the content of the to-do), and 'completed' (a boolean indicating whether the to-do is completed).

2-'methods: { ... }': This section defines methods that can be called within the Vue application.

    -'addTodo(event)': This method is called when a new to-do is added. It pushes a new to-do object into the 'todoList' array. The 'id' is 
    generated using the current timestamp, and the 'text' is taken from the input field value. The 'completed' property is set to 'false', 
    indicating that the to-do is not completed. After adding, the input field value is cleared.
    -'removeItem(todoItem)': This method removes a to-do item from the 'todoList' array. It uses the 'filter' method to create a new array 
    excluding the selected to-do item.

3-'computed: { ... }': This section defines computed properties that derive their values from the existing data.

    -'completedItemCount()': This computed property calculates the number of completed to-do items by filtering the 'todoList' array and 
    counting the number of items with 'completed' set to 'true'.
    -'unCompletedItemCount()': This computed property calculates the number of uncompleted to-do items by filtering the 'todoList' array 
    and counting the number of items with 'completed' set to 'false'.

4-'app.mount("#app");': This mounts the Vue application to an HTML element with the id '#app'.

-In summary, this code creates a simple to-do list application where you can add new to-do items, mark them as completed, and remove them. 
The computed properties help you dynamically calculate the number of completed and uncompleted to-do items.
